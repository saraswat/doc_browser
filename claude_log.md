Perfect! I've successfully added PDF support to the document browser application. Here's what's been implemented:

  ✅ PDF Support Added

  New Features:
  - PDF Document Loading: Enhanced document loader to handle both HTML and PDF files
  - PDF Metadata Extraction: Extract title, author, page count, and creation date from PDFs
  - PDF Viewer Component: In-browser PDF rendering using base64 embedding
  - Download Functionality: Download button for PDF documents
  - Type Detection: Automatic detection of document type (HTML vs PDF)

  Key Components Added:

  1. Enhanced Document Loader (utils/document_loader.py):
    - load_document_content() - Handles both HTML and PDF files
    - extract_pdf_metadata() - Extracts PDF metadata using PyPDF2
    - get_document_type() - Determines file type automatically
  2. PDF Viewer Component (components/pdf_viewer.py):
    - Base64 PDF embedding for in-browser viewing
    - Metadata display with PDF-specific information
    - Download functionality as fallback
  3. Updated Main Viewer (components/document_viewer.py):
    - render_document() - Routes to appropriate viewer based on file type
    - Seamless switching between HTML and PDF rendering

  Sample PDF Documents Created:
  - Financial Summary (2024-01-30): Q4 2023 financial metrics with tables and KPIs
  - Product Roadmap (2024-02-05): 2024 development roadmap with milestones and tech stack

  Updated Metadata includes document type information for proper categorization.

  The application now running at http://localhost:8502 supports:
  - HTML documents with rich styling and charts
  - PDF documents with in-browser viewing
  - Metadata extraction for both formats
  - Download functionality for PDFs
  - Unified interface for both document types

  Users can now select from 6 documents (4 HTML + 2 PDF) and the app automatically renders them appropriately based on file type.

I've successfully implemented Phase 1 of the document browser application according to the instructions in claude_instructions.md. Here's what has been completed:

  ✅ Phase 1 Complete - Basic Document Browser

  Core Features Implemented:
  - Modern Streamlit web application with clean UI
  - Document selection via name and date dropdowns
  - HTML document rendering with preserved styling, tables, and charts
  - Document metadata extraction and display
  - Responsive layout with sidebar navigation

  Project Structure Created:
  document_browser/
  ├── app.py                      # Main Streamlit application
  ├── requirements.txt            # Dependencies
  ├── .streamlit/config.toml     # Streamlit configuration  
  ├── components/
  │   ├── document_viewer.py     # HTML rendering component
  │   └── selectors.py           # Dropdown selectors
  ├── documents/
  │   ├── metadata.json          # Document registry
  │   └── content/               # Sample HTML documents
  └── utils/
      └── document_loader.py     # Document loading utilities

  Sample Documents Created:
  - AI Research Report (Jan & Feb 2024) - with tables and progress bars
  - Market Analysis (Jan 2024) - with metrics cards and competitive analysis
  - Technical Specification (Jan 2024) - with system architecture and API specs

  Key Technical Features:
  - streamlit.components.html() for full HTML rendering
  - BeautifulSoup for metadata extraction
  - Streamlit caching for performance
  - Modular component architecture
  - Error handling and fallback rendering

  The application is now running on port 8501 and ready for testing. Users can browse documents using the dropdown selectors and view rich HTML content with preserved
   styling.

  To run:
  cd document_browser
  streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501

  This provides a solid foundation for Phase 2 (authentication) and Phase 3 (feedback system) as outlined in the specifications.
